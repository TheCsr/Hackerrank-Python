Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers X,Y and N representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer N . You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k)  on a 3D grid where the sum of  is not equal to . Here, 

Input Format

Four integers  and  each on four separate lines, respectively.

Constraints

Print the list in lexicographic increasing order.

Sample Input

1
1
1
2
Sample Output

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]] 



if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = int(raw_input())
    y = int(raw_input())
    z = int(raw_input())
    n = int(raw_input())
    print ([[a,b,c] for a in range(0,x+1) for b in range(0,y+1) for c in range(0,z+1) if a+b+c!=n])
